(From an old guide I made on best audio plugins to start with. I have many more than these and will add them at some point in the future)

- [Komplete Start](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/?ref=eliasjackson.com) - a Native Instruments bundle that comes with lots of free sampled instruments, as well as the free version of Guitar Rig 6 (a collection of virtual guitar amps).
- [Spitfire LABS](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/?ref=eliasjackson.com) - More sampled instruments.
- [Vital](https://vital.audio/?ref=eliasjackson.com) - A powerful wavetable synthesizer that you can use to make leads, pads, basses, FX, etc.
- [Sitala](https://decomposer.de/sitala/?ref=eliasjackson.com) - a drum sampler that you can add your own sounds to (not necessary if you're using Ableton, since that comes with Drum Machine).
- [AFreeStudio.com](https://afreestudio.com/?ref=eliasjackson.com)
- [Bedroom Producers Blog: Free VST Plugins](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/free-vst-plugins/?ref=eliasjackson.com)
- [Free REAPER Plugins](https://youtu.be/2W8gbpfxwiM?ref=eliasjackson.com)

### Paid Plugins

- [Toontrack EZDrummer](https://www.toontrack.com/product/ezdrummer-2/?ref=eliasjackson.com) - high-quality sampled drums for rock and metal
- [Rift](https://www.minimal.audio/products/rift?ref=eliasjackson.com) - my favorite distortion plugin. I can spend all day making creative and transformative effects with this.
- [iZotope Neutron](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/neutron.html?ref=eliasjackson.com) - A mixing chain that comes with an EQ, compressor, exciter, and gate. Ableton comes with pretty good mixing plugins already, but I use this with REAPER a lot. The visual feedback and the AI features do a lot to speed up my mixing workflow.
- [Sononym](https://www.sononym.net/?ref=eliasjackson.com) - technically not a plugin since it's a standalone program that runs outside of the DAW. This is an AI-powered sample manager that analyzes, compares, and organizes all of your sounds, and you can drag samples into your DAW for instant use.
