A **proprietary** to-do list app that I sometimes use. Getting back into it in 2025.

## Setup

- I have a _Focus_ list which usually just contains one item: the one I’m currently working on. This item can be swapped out with others throughout the day as my focus changes.
- On the same page, I have an _In the Deck_ list, which contains items that are within my current [cognitive capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load). These are things that I’m allowing myself to think about even if I’m not currently working on them.
    - Importantly, this list should not contain more than 5 items at a time (hard limit of 7).
- On a **separate page**, I have a _Backlog_ which contains items that are outside of my current cognitive capacity. These are things that I don’t want to worry about at the moment, and therefore I don’t want them in view while I’m looking at the items that I need to focus on.
    - This list can fill up quickly, so I set a “due date” of 30 days after the item was posted, and if it didn’t get done by that point, I either do it right away or delete it. (In rare cases, I might push the due date back a week, but if it keeps getting pushed back then I need to evaluate why that is and fix the issue)

Tasks will frequently move between these three lists as different projects develop and priorities change (anyone who’s done agile software development should be familiar with this). Having just a small number of items in view at any given time (as opposed to, say, a Miro board with hundreds of virtual sticky notes) dramatically eases my anxiety and allows me to take things one step at a time.
