A **FOSS** command-line tool for downloading videos from YouTube and other websites. This is the successor to youtube-dl, which doesn't get updates as often anymore and therefore doesn't work as well.

There are graphical interfaces for it as well, but these come and go over time, so it's best to just search Google and Reddit for `yt-dlp gui`.

## Tips
- If downloads continuously fail, run `yt-dlp --update` to install the latest version.
- Use `-x` to just download audio.
