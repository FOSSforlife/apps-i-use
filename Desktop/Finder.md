The default **proprietary** file manager app that comes with MacOS. A lot of people hate it, but I'm okay with it.

## Tips
- `Space` to quick-preview files (super handy if you want to view an image/audio file without waiting for another application to open and close)
- `Cmd+Shift+Space` to show hidden files.
	- This is especially important when launching Finder from another application (e.g. uploading from a browser)
- When using keyboard navigation, `Enter` changes the file name, and `Cmd+Down` opens the file. (Weird, I know)
