A **FOSS** alternative to Photoshop. It has been around for a while and is popular among Linux users (because you can't use Photoshop on Linux).

I often use it on my Mac, even though I also own Affinity Photo (which has more feature parity with Photoshop), because GIMP is what I've been using for many years so it feels more familiar to me than other (better) software.

## Tips
- `Shift+S` to scale the current layer (horizontally, vertically, or both)
- **File** > **Open as Layers** to add an image on top of what you're currently working on.
	- Of course, you can also usually copy and paste from whatever image viewer or web browser you're using, but this is a nice backup to have.
- Easiest way to make an image transparent: 
	- Right-click the layer > **Add Alpha Channel**
	- Two options from here:
		- Remove background color: **Layer** > **Transparency** > **Color to Alpha**
		- Select specific part(s) you want to be transparent (using any option from the **Select** menu), and then hit `Fn+Delete` or `Backspace`.
