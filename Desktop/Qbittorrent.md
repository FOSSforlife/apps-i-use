Qbittorrenting is a **FOSS** torrenting app that you can use to download Linux distros and things like that. I do *not* condone using it for illegal purposes.

## Downloading files
1. In **Preferences** > **Advanced**, set **Network Interface** to your desired connection (e.g. VPN) 
2. [Download qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org).
3. [Install search plugins](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Install-search-plugins).
4. Verify that the IP address being shared by qbittorrent is accurate using the **Torrent Address detection** on [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net). 
5. Use the search engine inside qBitTorrent to search for content, and double-click any item to download.

## Setting up a streaming server
1. On your computer (or a dedicated home server if you have one), download and install [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) (most common, best device support) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) (an open source alternative, works on most but not all platforms). Follow the instructions to set up your media folders.
2. Download the Plex or Jellyfin apps on your phone, TV box, etc. Access your server either by logging in or using the IP address of your computer/server.
