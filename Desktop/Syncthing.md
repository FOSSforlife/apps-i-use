Syncthing is a **FOSS** application that you can download on multiple desktops and servers to sync folders between them. It is peer-to-peer, cross-platform, and has a great community.

## Tips
- The `.stignore` file, which can be used to exclude files based on glob patterns, uses the same syntax as a `.gitignore` file (so you can just run `cp .gitignore .stignore` in the command line to sync them)
