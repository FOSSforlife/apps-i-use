A mostly **FOSS** code editor that's cross-platform and pretty fast (for an Electron app).

## Why not use an open-source fork like VSCodium?

I do on some of my machines. However, Microsoft has made it so that only VSCode has the best SSH features, and accessing remote files is an important part of my workflow.

## Extensions
- Rainbow CSV
- Thunder Client
- Todo Tree
- vscode-spotify
