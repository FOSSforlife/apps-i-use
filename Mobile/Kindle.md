I read Kindle books on my phone. I prefer this over a separate Kindle device because: 
- It's always with me.
- It doesn't feel awkward to hold in bed.
- I can highlight text in different colors.
- I can listen and read at the same time using Whispersync for Voice.
	- Unfortunately this costs extra per book, but it's worth it in my opinion.
