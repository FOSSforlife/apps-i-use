Some mobile-specific tips for YouTube:
- The easiest way to disable ads and enable background listening (while using other apps) is to subscribe to **YouTube Premium**, which is what I've done. However, there are ways around this (use at your own caution because I have not tested them):
	- I've heard that accessing YouTube through Brave Browser enables these features.
	- On Android, you can download alternative YouTube apps through F-Droid.
	- On iOS, you might be able to do this by jailbreaking, although I don't know if anyone still does that (it feels like the scene may have died).
	- You might want to just buy Premium anyway since it also offers a really good interface for downloading content offline, useful for long walks and flights.
- The new **Podcasts** feature, when combined with background listening, is great. Its selection has grown a lot and is comparable to Spotify and Apple Podcasts, plus unlike those platforms you get a video feed and a comments section.
