I have been using Last.fm, a **proprietary** service, to keep track of my music listening since 2014, giving me a wealth of interesting data to analyze.

You can connect it to almost any music player or service, including Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. The Premium subscription lets you mass-edit album names, which is useful (e.g. if the Spotify version has `(Deluxe Version)` in the name but you want to merge it with the one that doesn't)

FOSS alternatives include [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/) (by the amazing Musicbrainz team) and [Maloja](https://github.com/krateng/maloja).
