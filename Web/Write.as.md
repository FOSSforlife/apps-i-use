Write.as is a web platform that I use to host my personal website/blog, [eliasjackson.com](https://eliasjackson.com). 

It is based on the minimalistic **FOSS** tool WriteFreely, which can be self-hosted. I pay for the service instead because it makes email subscriptions easier and it's less for me to worry about maintaining.
